# qliber Task List

- [x] Audit existing qlib capabilities and outline Rust parity goals
- [x] Configure Cargo dependencies for performant data handling and logging
- [x] Implement dataset ingestion and transformation utilities
- [x] Implement quantitative feature calculations (returns, moving averages)
- [x] Implement evaluation metrics (cumulative & risk-adjusted)
- [x] Implement structured logging utilities following required schema
- [x] Add comprehensive tests covering data ingestion, feature, and metric flows
- [x] Document project structure, usage, and design decisions
- [x] Validate Rust metrics parity with Qlib risk analysis outputs (sum & product modes)
- [x] Extend metrics API with accumulation modes, information ratio, and drawdown support
- [x] Refresh documentation and regression tests to capture the expanded evaluation surface
- [x] Harden logging initialization to be concurrency-safe and idempotent
- [x] Align Rust risk analysis API with Python frequency handling and return semantics
- [x] Port indicator analysis weighting logic to Rust metrics module
- [x] Expand regression tests and docs to cover the newly ported evaluation features
- [x] Add string-based compatibility wrappers for risk and indicator analysis APIs
- [x] Extend tests to validate scaler/frequency handling and Python mode parity
- [x] Document the parity helpers in the README for downstream consumers
- [x] Ensure Rust risk metrics filter non-finite returns to match Python semantics
